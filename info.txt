Entrance:
Upon entering the house, there is a genkan (a traditional Japanese entryway) where shoes are removed before stepping into the main living areas.

Living Room (Zashiki):
The living room typically features tatami flooring, low furniture like floor cushions or a low table, and may have a tokonoma (a recessed alcove) for displaying art or a scroll.

Dining Area:
Adjacent to the living room, there is a dining area with a low dining table and cushions or chairs. It may have sliding doors or screens that can be opened to merge the dining area with an outdoor garden or patio.

Kitchen:
The kitchen is usually compact and functional, often with minimalist design elements. It may include a small island or breakfast bar for casual dining.

Bedrooms (Washitsu):
The bedrooms are also typically furnished with tatami mats. They can be designed with sliding shoji doors or fusuma (sliding paper doors). Futons or low beds are commonly used for sleeping.

Bathroom and Toilet:
Separate areas house the bathroom and toilet. The bathroom often includes a deep soaking tub (ofuro) for relaxation and a separate shower area.

Engawa:
An engawa is a transitional space between the indoors and outdoors. It is a covered veranda that surrounds the house, offering a place to sit and enjoy the garden or nature.

Garden:
Japanese-style houses often feature a small garden or outdoor space designed with elements like a rock garden, pond, bonsai trees, or carefully arranged plants for a serene ambiance.

Additional Rooms:
Depending on the size of the house and personal preferences, there may be additional rooms like a study or a tea room (chashitsu) for practicing the traditional tea ceremony.
